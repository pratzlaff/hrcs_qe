  <h1>HRC-S QE N0015</h1>

  <p>
    From regular HRC-S/LETG calibration observations of the hot white
    dwarf HZ 43<sup><a href="#fn1" id="reffn1">1</a></sup>, it is
    known that the HRC-S QE has declined steadily at wavelengths
    longer than 60 &#8491; (200 eV).  This drop has been linear since
    the high tension voltage change in March, 2012, at a yearly loss
    rate of 2.39 (&pm; 0.04)&percnt; (more precisely, the QE decline
    is modeled as linear versus time with a slope of [1-0.0239] units
    per annum) in dispersed orders (<a href="#fig1"
    id="reffig1">Fig.&nbsp;1</a>). While in the past decade there have
    been increasingly large
    <a href="https://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/caldb4/downloads/Release_notes/CALDB_v4.9.1.html#TD_HRCS_QEU_N0013">additional
    position-dependent corrections</a> necessary for the outer plates,
    broadly speaking the linear QE decline can be characterized as
    &quot;grey,&quot; i.e., independent of wavelength.
  </p>

  <p>
    Despite the lack of a standard candle that illuminates the entire
    detector, there is still one useful source available for relative
    calibration of the central plate: the isolated neutron star RX
    J1856.5-3754. This source, although somewhat faint (&sim;0.11
    counts s<sup>-1</sup> for positive first order in the 20-60 &#8491
    band), yields measurable flux for wavelengths longer than 20
    &#8491; on S2, and has been observed with the HRC-S/LETG
    configuration in 2001, 2013 and 2019. Comparison of fluxes from
    those epochs, derived with the current CalDB, which extends the
    2.39% QE loss per year to all dispersed wavelengths, is consistent
    with the assumption of grey decline (<a href="#fig2"
    id="reffig2">Fig.&nbsp;2</a>). The calculated fluxes in both 2013
    and 2019 are in agreement to the approximately 10&percnt; level
    with those from 2001.
  </p>

  <p>
    For higher energies, we are left with extragalactic sources such
    as the blazar Markarian 421, which is highly variable, displaying
    variations of &gt;50&percnt; over timescales of 10s of ksec. For
    the purpose of cross calibration, it is often observed in a
    sequence of consecutive interleaved instrument/grating (ACIS-S
    with HETGS and LETGS, HRC-S with LETGS) configurations.  We then
    model the flux light curve as a continuous auto-regressive model
    (CARMA&semi; Kelly et
    al. <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...788...33K/abstract">2014</a>),
    adjusting the relative QE calibration of HRC-S to ensure the
    smoothest curve through the instrument changes to and from
    ACIS-S. Examples of these interleaved observations are shown in
    <a href="#fig3" id="reffig3">Fig.&nbsp;3</a>, for the past three
    years, in the 3-6 &#8491; band. The left side panels show flux
    curves in the years 2017-2019, using the current CalDB HRC-S QE
    version N0014. As can be seen in the lower left plot, the
    discontinuity between HRC-S/LETG (blue) and ACIS-S/LETG (black)
    has become especially pronounced in recent years. <a href="#fig4"
    id="reffig4">Figs.&nbsp;4-7</a> show similar trends for other
    wavelength bands, going out to 18 &#8491;.
  </p>

  <p>
    Calibrating the HRC-S to ACIS-S via Mkn 421 while assuming the
    ACIS-S QE remains constant requires, at the shortest wavelengths,
    raising the HRC-S QE increasingly over time.  Though these data
    are at low signal-to-noise, some trends in the required QE
    correction are apparent.  The discrepancy between ACIS-S and HRC-S
    is roughly correlated with wavelength: shorter wavelengths require
    more modification. Similarly, the disagreement between detectors
    is generally growing over time, and this appears to have begun
    around the same time as the HV change in 2012.
  </p>

  <p>
    We address the flux discrepancy by <b>raising the HRC-S QE
    relative to the grey correction the most at shortest wavelengths,
    linearly ramping down that excess correction to unity (i.e., no
    additional correction beyond the grey secular one) at 20
    &#8491;</b>. Additionally, <b>the QE will be linearly increased
    over time, post HV change</b>, in order to compensate for the grey
    secular correction (<a href="#fig8" id="reffig8">Fig.&nbsp;8</a>).
  </p>

  <p>
    Beginning in 2013, QE N0015 contains one calibration file per
    year. At the shortest wavelength (0 &#8491;), the QE in S2 rises
    at the rate of 2.1&percnt; per year (a linear increase versus time
    with a slope of 1.021 units per year relative to 2012.5), which
    was the value found to most closely match the factor which must be
    applied to the highest energy HRC-S fluxes so that they agree with
    ACIS-S. This upwards correction shorter than 20 &#8491; on S2 is
    counter to the grey decline implemented in the QEU.  Together, the
    QEU correction and new QE counter-correction amount to a net
    &quot;real&quot; decline in HRC-S QE of 0.34&percnt; per year at
    the highest energies. This wavelength-dependent correction of the
    HRC-S QE, in addition to linearly ramping up with time, also
    linearly ramps down with wavelength until it is zeroed out
    relative to the grey correction at 20 &#8491;.
  </p>

  <p>
    The right side panels in <a href="#fig4"
    id="reffig4">Figs.&nbsp;4-7</a> show how the HRC-S fluxes change
    with this QE update. They are generally in better agreement with
    ACIS-S, although the 6-9 &#8491 and 12-15 &#8491; bands still
    require additional scrutiny, particularly in the latest 2019
    observations. The upcoming interleaved calibration observations in
    July, 2020 will shine further light on the situation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The plerionic supernova remnant G21.5-0.9 can provide a
    consistency check on our corrections. The plerion has a
    highly-absorbed spectrum, with X-ray emission almost entirely at
    energies greater than 1 keV (<a href="#fig9"
    id="reffig9">Fig.&nbsp;9</a>). As shown in <a href="#fig10"
    id="reffig10">Fig.&nbsp;10</a>, the latest HRC-S imaging plerion
    flux measurements using QE N0015 more closely match historical
    values than did those computed from the N0014 version.
